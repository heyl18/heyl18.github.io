Research experience
======
**School of Software, Tsinghua University Jun. 2021 – Sep. 2021**\
*Supervised by Assoc. Prof. [Jiliang Wang](http://tns.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jiliang/)*\
**Wireless Power Distribution Unit**
* Studied how to deploy large-scale wireless sensor networks; implemented a new taking-turns protocol to allow a single gateway to connect to over 300 wireless nodes simultaneously
* Designed and implemented the backend of this project, which was used for collecting data from wireless gateways and providing collected data to the front end

**Fundamental Industry Training Center, Tsinghua University Oct. 2019 – May. 2020**\
**Automatic Delivery robot**
* Built a robot that can automatically deliver goods indoors based on Arduino and Raspberry Pi; implemented basic visual algorithms (Hough Transform) for indoor localization
* Participated in Beijing University Student Engineering Ability Competition for 2019; won the first prize and the best design award

Selected Projects
======

**Internet of Things**
- In the course of Introduction to Internet of things, our group (3 students) designed and implemented an acoustic communication system using basic modulate methods such as OOK and FSK. We also implemented a high accuracy acoustic ranging system, based on this paper: *BeepBeep: a high accuracy acoustic ranging system using COTS mobile devices*

**Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence**
- In the course of Machine Learning, our group (4 students) reproduced several papers on deep reinforcement learning (DQN, double DQN and Rainbow etc.). We used the algorithms proposed in these papers to let the AI learn how to play Atari games. Our implementation perfectly reproduced the results of the original experiments. 

**Software Development**
- In the course of Software Engineering, our group (4 students) developed a sports meeting management system based on Django, Vue and MySQL. The administrators can manage sports events while the athletes can check relevant information through the website.

- In the course of Introduction to Mobile Application Development, our group (3 students) designed and implemented a user-friendly instant messaging App on Android, which allowed users to send all types of messages to others and share their moments with others.
