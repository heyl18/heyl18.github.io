Research experience
======
**School of Software, Tsinghua University Jun. 2021 – Sep. 2021**\
*Supervised by Assoc. Prof. [Jiliang Wang](http://tns.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jiliang/)*\
**Intelligent Wireless Power Distribution Unit**
* Studied how to deploy large scale wireless sensor network; Designed and implemented new taking-turns protocol to support more wireless devices at the same time (Over 500 devices)
* Implemented the backend of this project, including a Spring Boot based Web backend and a MQTT broker. The backend was mainly used for collecting data from the wireless gateways

**Fundamental Industry Training Center, Tsinghua University Oct. 2019 – May. 2020**\

* Participated in Beijing University Student Engineering Ability Competition 2019 and won the first prize & Best Design award

Selected Projects
======

**Internet of Things**
-	In the course of Introduction to Internet of things, our group (3 students) designed and implemented an acoustic communication system. We also implemented a high accuracy acoustic ranging system, based on this paper: *BeepBeep: a high accuracy acoustic ranging system using COTS mobile devices*

**Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence**
- In the course of Machine Learning, our group (4 students) implemented deep reinforcement learning algorithms (DQN, double DQN and Rainbow etc.) with Python and PyTorch. Our implementation perfectly reproduced the results of the original experiments. 

**Software Development**
- In the course of Software Engineering, our group (4 students) developed a Track and field Games management application based on Django, Vue and MySQL, which allowed users to manage the athletes and fill in the relevant information.

- In the course of Introduction to Mobile Application Development, our group (3 students) developed an instant messaging App on Android, which allowed users to chat with others and to send all types of messages to others.
